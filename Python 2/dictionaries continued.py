#when counta=ing the items in a list (like pylist) the counting length stars at 1

#example of this 
#classmates = {"Hello" : 0, "Jleo" : 7, "kal" : 9, "welxcome" :10}
#print(len(classmates))
#will print 4 becasue thats the number of items in the list if its starts countaing at 1

#you can also check for a key in a vaule (reminer (key: value))


#dino = {"t rex" : 50, "long neck" : 100, "raptor" : 15, "triceratops"  : 30}

#if "t rex" in dino: 
    #print("t rex is in youe dictionary")

#checks for t rex and will only print that staement if it is in the dictionary

#you can also he opposite 


#dino = {"t rex" : 50, "long neck" : 100, "raptor" : 15, "triceratops"  : 30}

#if "rhino" not in dino: 
    #print("rhino is not in your dictionary")

#will print rhino is not in your dictinary 


#you can convert a py list to a py dictionary 

#example 

#garden = ["pumkin", "squash",  "corn", "tomatoes"] 
#garden_dictionary = dict.fromkeys(garden, "Harvested")
#break down the code (set a dictionary ) with dict, name the list (garden) use fromkeys uses the list to set a vaule to all  the keys (garden, "vaule") in he second place is the vaule that will be set to all keys in the dictionary 
#print(garden_dictionary)

#coins = {"pennies" : .01, "nickels" : .05 , "dimes" : .1, "quarters" : .25}
#coins["silvar dollar"] = 1
#coins.pop("pennies")
#print(coins)
#print(len(coins))
