#funtions is a code that only runs when its called (like a button)

#def weather():
    #print("it's a soggy day outside!")
    #out was nothing 

#to press the button (funtion) "weather" you have to call on it 
#press = call 

#weather()
#untill funtion was called here did the string  print 

#the use is that we have this code written but don't want to use it right away

# it can be compared to an alarm too 
#alarms exist but won't ring unless you set it up

#local variable is a inside of a funtion (that means it will only be called when the funtion is called 

#favorite = "I love juice" #global variable bcs outside function
#def myfunction():
    #global fruit #local variable cause inside function
    #fruit = "apple" 
    
#myfunction()
#print(favorite)
#print(fruit)
